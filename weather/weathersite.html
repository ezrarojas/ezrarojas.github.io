                Weather Site Plan
            </h1>
            <h2>
                Purpose
            </h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of The Weather Site is to give current weather conditions in 3 different ways. The initial page will give the <br>
                weather for the current location based on the Geocoding location information from the device.  The second is weather for <br>
                3 specific locations accessible through a dedicated link, and the third is weather for any location determined by a search <br>
                string.  
            </p>
            <h2>
                Audience
            </h2>
            <p>
                Primary audience is adults ages 18-30.  Most will be students.  Access to the site will be split between mobile devices <br>
                and laptops. A secondary audience will be anyone interested in weather. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                Audince Goals
            </h2>
            <p>
                College students move around quite a bit so one goal would be to quickly get the weather conditions for their current <br>
                location as they head off to class or study. They are also often far from their homes so the ability to quickly get the <br>
                conditions for a specific location is important as well.  The third goal deals with planning for travels...the ability to <br>
                get weather conditions for any location will help with last minute packing for road trips.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Name: Joe Cool

                <li>
                    Motivation: Joe is not into planning. His last minute scrampling, whether it is getting to calss in the morning or <br>
                    heading out on his latest adventure, has left him unprepared for weather. conditions many times (He is tired of <br>
                    sleeping in the rain and snow).  He would like to be more prepared...without having to put much effort into it...or <br>
                    planning.

                <li>

                    Many of the places he frequents do not have great signalâ€¦he is often dealing with 3G speeds

                    descriptor, forecast percentage of precipitation, and current wind speed and direction on small devices and hourly <br>
                    temps should be added on larger screens. The pages of the Weather Site will be built in the following order:
