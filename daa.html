                    H&M utilize grouping techniques to organize their content in a clean manner. In the home page, they group <br>
                    similar items such as pictures in order to create a most appealing view for visitors so it is easy to <br>
                    identify offers and commonly purchased items. They also show grouping of icons with a top boundary in <br>
                    order to utilize the most common commands such as login, search, like and shopping cart.

                    The company also does a good job of alignment techniques in the mobile website as displayed in the Menu bar <br>
                    where all the sections are left aligned and with appropriate spacing between border lines and actual text. <br>
                    The top quick links are also appropriately right aligned in order to separate them from the menu button which <br>
                    is left aligned next to the H&M logo.

                    H&M departments and catalogs are organized by sizes. Departments are smaller and catalogs/articles are larger. <br>
                    This makes the page look uniform and helps to make these links easily identifiable by distinguishing the <br>
                    different categories from one another.

                    The bar at the top of the website remains no matter what page you are on. This makes it difficult for users to <br>
                    get lost on the website, giving them a singular and constant reference point.

                    The main color scheme here seems to be white and red. This is a contrast between warm and cool colors, which <br>
                    causes the eye to be attracted to any red on the screen. The most notable use of red on this website is the <br>
                    sites logo and the “sale” banner.

                    The magazine section of the website trades a white background for a dark one. This color change makes it <br>
                    apparent to the user that they have transitioned from one part of the website to another. You can also <br>
                    see in this section that the dark background contrasts with the bright pictures, emphasizing these images <br>
                    to the viewer.

                    The layout of type that H & M uses is interesting because it uses a very simple type font. <br>
                    They use it so it is easy for the user to read and understand. The colors that were chosen also <br>
                    make the typography a key part of the website because they chose a light font color when the <br>
                    background is dark and also choose a dark font color when the background is light. For example, <br>
                    white font against a navy blue background or black font against a light tan background.
